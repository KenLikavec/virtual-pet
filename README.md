My virtual pet project begins with a golden retriever named Dug.
The point of the application is to take care of Dug's basic needs which in this case are 1.)Hunger 2.)Activeness and 3.)Obedience do these things and Dug will live a long happy life.
The way to gauge if hes in good shape is to look at his stats which will be at the very top.
The higher the numerical value his stats are the better shape hes in meaning his appetite exersice and training are all in good order.
The choices you make through out the application directly impact Dug's overall shape.
